# EMAT20011_Intro_to_Data_Science
This is a repository to document the work conducted alongside the "Introduction to Data Science (EMAT20011)" module at the University of Bristol.  

It is a MATLAB-based data science / analysis course, and so experiments will be conducted using MATLAB (R2020b), through the use of "Live Scripts" for Jupyter Notebook-like interaction. Code will subsequently be exported as a PDF file for native viewing in GitHub on the browser.
